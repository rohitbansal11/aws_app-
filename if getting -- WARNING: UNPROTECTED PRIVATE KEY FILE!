To fix this,

youâ€™ll need to reset the permissions back to default:

sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
If you are getting another error:

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/home/geek/.ssh/known_hosts).
This means that the permissions on that file are also set incorrectly, and can be adjusted with this:

sudo chmod 644 ~/.ssh/known_hosts
Finally, you may need to adjust the directory permissions as well:

sudo chmod 755 ~/.ssh
This should get you back up and running.
